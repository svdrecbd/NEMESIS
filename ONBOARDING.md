# Developer Onboarding
**NEMESIS Development Guide**

This document provides a technical overview of the NEMESIS codebase for new contributors. It covers the system architecture, data models, and development workflow.

## Architecture Overview

NEMESIS is built with **PySide6 (Qt)** and follows a modular design to support stability during long-duration experiments.

### Core Concepts

*   **Tabbed Workspace**: The main window (`app/main.py`) manages a list of tabs. Each tab acts as an isolated sandbox for a specific experimental rig or data view.
*   **RunSession**: Encapsulates the state of a live experiment, including the camera connection, serial link, active loggers, and hardware workers. This isolation ensures that a hardware failure in one tab does not affect others.
*   **Multiprocessing Engine**: To ensure a responsive UI on high-resolution displays, heavy computational tasks run in separate processes.
    *   **FrameWorker**: Runs in a thread, captures video frames, and writes them to a **Shared Memory Ring Buffer**.
    *   **ProcessCVWorker**: Manages a separate OS process (`run_cv_process`) that reads frames directly from RAM (Zero-Copy) to perform tracking analysis without blocking the main application loop (GIL-free).

## Data Pipeline

The system generates run artifacts in `runs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<token>/`.

### 1. Stimulus Logs (`taps.csv`)
Records every mechanical event command sent to the hardware.
*   **t_host_ms**: Monotonic host timestamp.
*   **t_fw_ms**: Firmware execution timestamp (for latency verification).
*   **mode**: Schedule type (Periodic, Poisson, Replicant).
*   **mark**: Scheduled vs. Manual tap.
*   **frame_recorded_idx**: The specific video frame index corresponding to the tap.

### 2. Tracking Logs (`tracking.csv`)
Generated by the CV pipeline (`TrackingLogger`). Records the state of the organism for every processed frame.
*   **stentor_id**: Unique ID assigned to a tracked object.
*   **state**: Classification result (CONTRACTED, EXTENDED, UNDETERMINED).
*   **state=NONE**: Explicit rows emitted when no detections are present in a frame (keeps the sequence dense).
*   **circularity/area**: Geometric features used for classification.
*   **edge_reflection**: Flag set when a detection falls near the dish edge (possible reflection).

### 3. Frame Timeline (`frames.csv`)
A full frame index + timestamp timeline for aligning taps and CV outputs, used for fixed-step ML exports.

### 4. Metadata (`run.json`)
A snapshot of the configuration parameters used to initiate the run, ensuring reproducibility.
*   **schema_version**: Incremented when run metadata format changes.
*   **run_start_host_ms**: Monotonic start time used as the alignment baseline.
*   **camera_fps / camera_frame_size / preview_fps**: Capture settings at run start.
*   **cv_config**: CV thresholds and tracking parameters in effect during the run.

### ML Export Helper
Use `tools/export_sequences.py` to build fixed-step sequences (HMM/LSTM-ready) from a run folder.
See `docs/sample_sequence.csv` for the output shape.

## Computer Vision System

The `cvbot.py` module implements a lightweight tracking system designed for robust performance over days of operation.

1.  **Segmentation**: Uses an adaptive threshold on the inverted Red channel to isolate the green Stentor against a white background.
2.  **Tracking**: Implements a "Home Base" logic. Since Stentor are anchored, the tracker associates moving blobs with a fixed anchor point to maintain identity despite rapid shape changes.
3.  **Classification**: Determines state based on circularity and the velocity of shape change (detecting rapid contractions).

## Development Workflow

### Setup
Follow the installation steps in the README. Ensure you have the project requirements installed in a virtual environment.

### Code Style
*   **Type Hinting**: Use Python type hints for all function signatures.
*   **Logging**: Use `APP_LOGGER` from `app.core.logger` instead of `print`.
*   **Conventions**: Follow existing naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes).
*   **No Magic Numbers**: Promote literals to named constants at module scope. Prefer reuse and keep units explicit.
*   **Schema Awareness**: When changing run data formats, bump `schema_version` and update docs/tests.
*   **Theme Safety**: Use theme tokens (`BG`, `PLOT_FACE`, `TEXT`, etc.) instead of hardcoded colors.
*   **Error Handling**: Keep UI paths resilient (log, degrade gracefully, avoid crashing the run loop).
*   **Performance First**: Optimize hot paths (CV, render, logging) before adding features.
*   **Maintainability Second**: Favor clear structure, small functions, and predictable data flow.
*   **Keep Bloat Down**: Avoid unnecessary dependencies, duplicate logic, or heavy UI effects.

### Testing
The project includes a comprehensive test suite using `pytest`.
*   **Run All Tests**: `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. && python -m pytest tests/`
*   **Coverage**: Includes Unit Tests for CV logic, Drivers (mocked), and State management.

### Debugging
*   **Pro Mode**: Toggle in the UI to enable keyboard shortcuts for rapid testing.
*   **Hardware Simulation**: The application handles missing hardware gracefully. You can test UI logic without a camera or Arduino connected (warnings will appear, but the app will not crash).

### Release Process
1.  Update the version string in `VERSION` and `app/main.py`.
2.  Verify the `nemesis.spec` file encompasses new dependencies.
3.  Build the standalone executable using PyInstaller.

## Future Work
*   **UNIT1 Firmware/Protocol**: The UNIT1 path (`firmware/unit1/` and `docs/protocol.md`) is experimental and not part of the current release. Keep Arduino (`firmware/arduino/`) as the supported production target until UNIT1 is fully implemented and validated.
