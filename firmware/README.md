# NEMESIS Firmware Workspace

This directory holds hardware-side code and specs for the tapper controllers that NEMESIS can drive.

- `arduino/stentor_habituator_stepper_v9/` — Legacy Big Easy Driver sketch currently in use.
- `unit1/UNIT1_firmware/` — Scaffold for the future UNIT1 controller that will replace the Arduino while keeping the host protocol aligned with NEMESIS "Pure" mode.

Each target keeps its own build instructions and notes in a local `README.md`.
